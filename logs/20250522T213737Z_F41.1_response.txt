Provider: Let me do a quick check. everything sounds normal. Blood pressure looks good.
Patient: I just feel exhausted from always thinking. I can't sleep, and I'm always worrying
Provider: I'm sorry to hear that. Any panic attacks or thoughts of hurting yourself?
Patient: No, nothing like that. Just can't shut my brain off.
Provider: Have you tried anything to manage it? Breathing, therapy, medications?
Patient: I've tried some apps, but not much else.
