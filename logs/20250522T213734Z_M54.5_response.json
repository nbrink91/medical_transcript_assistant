Felt a pop, and now it's sore and stiff.\nProvider: Any numbness or tingling down your legs?\nPatient: Nope, just pain in my lower back. Hurts when I bend.\nProvider: Any bowel or bladder issues?\nPatient: Nope.\nProvider: Let's go through your systems. Headaches? Vision issues?\nPatient: No.\nProvider: Sleep okay? Appetite normal?\nPatient: Both good.\nProvider: Let me have you bend forward... any pain there?\nPatient: Yeah, a little tight.\nProvider: Tenderness on palpation... okay, I don't see signs of a herniated disc.
