User Prompt

Provider: Travis, let me quickly confirm any changes in your contact info or pharmacy?
Patient: Nope, all the same.
Provider: Okay, and any allergies?
Patient: I get a rash from sulfa drugs.
Provider: Thanks. so what happened to your back?
Patient: I lifted a box helping my neighbor move. Felt a pop, and now it's sore and stiff.
Provider: Any numbness or tingling down your legs?
Patient: Nope, just pain in my lower back. Hurts when I bend.
Provider: Any bowel or bladder issues?
Patient: Nope.
Provider: Let's go through your systems. Headaches? Vision issues?
Patient: No.
Provider: Sleep okay? Appetite normal?
Patient: Both good.
Provider: Let me have you bend forward... any pain there?
Patient: Yeah, a little tight.
Provider: Tenderness on palpation... okay, I don't see signs of a herniated disc. Sounds musculoskeletal. Let's check your range of motion and see if we need imaging.
Patient: I'd rather not do an MRI unless it's serious.
Provider: Totally reasonable. I'll recommend NSAIDs, heat, rest, and anti-inflammatories. If it doesn't improve in 7-10 days, we'll reassess.
Patient: Got it, thanks.
