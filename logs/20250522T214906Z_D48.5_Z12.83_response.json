It's asymmetric, has some irregular borders, and the color is uneven, about 7mm on the left shoulder near the top of the shoulder blade.\nPatient: That's not good, right?\nProvider: It's suspicious enough that I'd like to do a biopsy to rule out melanoma. We'll send it to pathology.\nPatient: Okay, let's do it.\nProvider: Let me check your lymph nodes. no swelling. Skin elsewhere looks clear.\nPatient: Thanks for being thorough.\nProvider: Of course.
