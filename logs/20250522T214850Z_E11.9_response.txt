Provider: Are you still taking the metformin twice a day?
Patient: I am, but I’ve missed a few doses. My sugars are still high some mornings.
Provider: Understood. Any new symptoms like numbness, vision changes, unusual thirst?
Patient: No new symptoms. I've been feeling tired, though.
Provider: Well, before we dive in, let me confirm a few things. You're still at the same address and phone number?
Patient: Yep, nothing’s changed.
Provider: Got it. Any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
