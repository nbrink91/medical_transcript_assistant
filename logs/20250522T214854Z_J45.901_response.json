    "user_prompt": "Provider: Hi Jamal, I see you came in after last week's dust storm. What's going on?\nPatient: Yeah, my chest got really tight. I had to use my rescue inhaler like four times in one day.\nProvider: Did you have any wheezing or trouble catching your breath?\nPatient: Both. It calmed down after a few hours, but it scared me.\nProvider: Any ER visits or hospital stays?\nPatient: No, I just waited it out.\nProvider: You did the right thing using the inhaler.\"\nProvider: Jamal, before we talk about your asthma flare-up, let's verify your info. Still working at the warehouse?\nPatient: Yeah, same job.\nProvider: Okay. Any new allergies or changes in your health history?\nPatient: No new allergies. Still allergic to cats and dust mites.\nProvider: Do you have any symptoms right now? Any fever, cough, chest pain?\nPatient: No fever, just tightness in my chest.\nProvider: GI or urinary issues?\nPatient: Nope.\nProvider: Mood okay? Any anxiety or sleep issues?\nPatient: I've been more tired, but I think it's just the asthma.\nProvider: Let's take a listen. you've got mild wheezing in the upper lobes. Oxygen saturation is 97%. No signs of distress now.\nPatient: I had to use my inhaler a lot last week.\nProvider: We'll do a peak flow test, then talk about adding a controller medication, especially during monsoon season. And stay indoors when the dust kicks up.\nPatient: That makes sense. I hate feeling like that.\n",

Symptoms included chest tightness, wheezing, and difficulty breathing. Patient required the use of his rescue inhaler four times in one day. Symptoms calmed after a few hours, and patient did not seek emergency care.\n\n**Review of Systems (ROS)**\n- Respiratory: Chest tightness, wheezing, difficulty breathing (Resolved after inhaler use).\n- General: Increased fatigue attributed to asthma.\n- No fever, cough, chest pain.\n- GI: No issues reported.\n- Urinary: No issues reported.\n- Mood: Normal, no anxiety or significant sleep disturbances.\n\n**Physical Exam**\n- Respiratory: Mild wheezing noted in upper lobes bilaterally; oxygen saturation 97%; no signs of respiratory distress.\n\n**Assessment and Plan**\n1. **Asthma Exacerbation** \u2013 Likely triggered by dust storm exposure. Current symptoms resolved after use of rescue inhaler:\n   - Perform peak flow test to assess lung function.\n   - Educate patient on avoiding outdoor exposure during dust storms.\n   - Recommend adding a controller medication to better manage asthma during high-risk seasons (e.g., monsoon season).\n   \n2. **Allergic Sensitivities** \u2013 Allergies to cats and dust mites contribute to asthma triggers:\n   - No changes in allergy management discussed.\n\n**Medications**\n- Rescue Inhaler (Albuterol): Used for acute asthma symptoms; frequency increased significantly during dust storm exposure.\n- Controller medication: To be discussed and potentially initiated (specific medication not yet determined)."
